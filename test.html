      <p>
     In world where Donald Trump is running for president, Kardashians being the number 1 media topic, Han Solo dying, Miley Cyrus' choice in wardrobe, and Kanye West being Kanye West our favorite Maverick Hunter (unless X or Axel are your favorite,I don't know your life) has seen this and has seemed to have encountered an error.  For those who don't know, Zero has a history of viruses that in most cases have proven to be deadly.  We don't know how this error will affect the zero virus so we strongly recommend you stay in doors.  Did we forget to mention  he was created by Dr. Wiley?
